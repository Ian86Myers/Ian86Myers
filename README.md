### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Here is an overview of my Software Development at IBM

# Audit

In 2023, I contributed to the GPA-Web project in Audit. GPA-Web is a web GUI that displays test reports and error messages for individual chip designs from an interactive table. I enhanced the frontend using React JS and the backend with Node.js, creating dynamic queries and endpoints. My key contributions included:

- A/B testing. I used a legacy app with known validity to test against as well as the source database.
- Utilized React hooks to fetch and manage data, to be held on state in our application and passed down the component tree as a prop object.
- Implemented a feature that allows users to view test and report links by clicking on the Cell Name column. Code example of how the message object is created.
- Enhanced layout, formatting, and filtering for improved user experience.
- Debugged existing features.
- Added `@eda/route-auth` middleware for authentication to front and backend to pass a security audit.
- Developed functions to construct file path links for various reports from multiple endpoints.
- Added a feature to gather current user tokens, display them in a ToolTip, and grant access to read external files.
- Updated backend Node.js code to fetch data efficiently.
- Utilized React JS (code) for an interactive table feature and presented mock-ups in Agile meetings.

# Infrastructure

During my tenure in infrastructure, I collaborated with mentors on a capstone project involving a React JS application to monitor server data. Key achievements:

- GitHub link: [ddServerInspector](https://github.ibm.com/ian-myers-ibm/infrastructure/tree/main/ddServerInspector)
- A/B testing was used to update legacy projects.
- Developed a dynamic MUI card component using `.map()` for servers, sorted and colored by status.
- Developed a dynamic MUI table with custom horizontal bars in cells by utilizing MUIâ€™s `renderCell` method.
- Implemented a multi-tiered navigation bar system for seamless content access.
- Utilized Chart JS to create interactive charts for each server and hosts. Dynamic bar chart & scatter plot.
- Created a graphical hierarchy of projects breakdown and memory allocation per each chip design. Code.
- Utilized Pandas and SQL to extract, process, and analyze data from a MySQL database, demonstrating strong data analysis skills.
- Achieved efficient querying and data retrieval using Pandas DataFrame, showcasing optimization skills for large datasets.
- Utilized `argparse` for command line argument parsing.
- Established a MySQL database connection with a stored password.
- Executed SQL queries to retrieve project metrics.
- Nested loop through SQL with Python to create hierarchical data.
- Created visualizations, including pie charts and tables, using Matplotlib.
- Server inventory script - To prepare for data migration and upgrading of existing servers. I wrote a bash script to:
  - Cron Job ran hourly for each server listed in database to help catch other automated scripts.
  - Handled conditions for different server architectures (linux & x86).
  - After implementing several filters I extracted all running processes, sub processes, and their owners per each server.
  - Created and populated a table for extracted data.
  - Filtered all rows for unknown or forgotten processes.
- Policy Warning report
  - Developed a Python script for policy warning reports, showcasing expertise in data manipulation and database interactions.
  - Implemented policy checks, including state management and time-based conditions, to identify inactive servers and potential issues.
  - Enhanced script readability and user-friendliness through well-structured code and informative output messages.
  - Demonstrated proficiency in command-line argument parsing and integration with external data sources for dynamic reporting.
  - Contributed to automated policy enforcement by identifying servers nearing spin-down thresholds, emphasizing practical coding abilities while providing a useful tool.
